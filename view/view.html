                                The Dalat Dream Protein Frappé offers several potential health benefits:
                                <br>
                                <span class="fw-bold text-warning">- Protein boost:</span> Protein is an essential
                                nutrient that plays
                                a crucial role in various
                                bodily functions, including muscle repair and growth, immune support, and hormone
                                production. The protein included in the frappé can help contribute to your daily protein
                                intake, especially if it contains ingredients like protein powder or plant-based protein
                                sources.
                                <br>
                                <span class="fw-bold text-warning">- Vietnamese coffee beans:</span> Vietnamese coffee
                                beans typically have a strong and distinct
                                flavor. Coffee, in moderation, can provide several benefits, including increased
                                alertness, enhanced cognitive function, and improved exercise performance. It contains
                                caffeine, which can help improve focus and mental clarity.
                                <br>
                                <span class="fw-bold text-warning">- Nutritional balance:</span> The addition of almond
                                or
                                coconut milk to the frappé can provide a
                                source of healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. These plant-based milk alternatives are
                                typically low in saturated fat and cholesterol and may offer additional nutrients like
                                vitamin E and calcium.
                                <br>
                                <span class="fw-bold text-warning">- Guilt-free pleasure:</span> The Dalat Dream Protein
                                Frappé can be enjoyed as a guilt-free
                                treat. By using natural sweeteners or minimal added sugar, and opting for healthier
                                toppings like whipped coconut cream, you can indulge in a flavorful drink without
                                excessive calories or added sugars found in traditional frappés or milkshakes.
                                Refreshing and satisfying: The frozen and blended nature of the frappé, combined with
                                the flavors of Vietnamese coffee and creamy almond or coconut milk, can provide a
                                refreshing and satisfying beverage option. It can be a delightful way to cool down and
                                enjoy a flavorful treat.
